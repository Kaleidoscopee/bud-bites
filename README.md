Link - (https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition)

You can simply type in the search bar and hit enter to find multiple variations of the food you searched for and it's calorie count! (may not be accurate due to API data 0.0)



# Progress
Was having trouble with errors on the original Repository and couldn't find the problem with Ms. Iya so was approved to continue here. Using it as a chance to clean up the code from the original repository of buddy-bites. (https://github.com/Kaleidoscopee/buddy-bites)

App is now completed, but can use more CSS to make it look nice.
Short term goal- I'd like to incorporate the Macro Nutrients(Protein,Carbs,Fats)
Mid Term goal- I'd like for the nutrients to be under calories in a carrot > like button to show hidden information of the macros like a dropdown menu
Long Term - A sliding or carasoul of the 9 options to go from left to right infinitely rotating upon click ex. < current recipe here >



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
